       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow `%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After  any  flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which is
       either E to use the locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the  locale's  alternate
       numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42
       -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating cal‐
       endar  date,  time  of  day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty
       string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format is more complex than is  easily  docu‐
       mented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

CAL(1)                                     BSD General Commands Manual                                    CAL(1)

NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout,
     more options and the date of Easter.  The new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80
     terminal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -e option, display date of Easter according to the
             Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal number, it may be followed by the
             letter ‘f’ or ‘p’ to indicate the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Gregorian Calendar as they are assumed by
             ncal.  The country code as determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date associated with the country_code.
             If not specified, ncal tries to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back to
             September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her colonies switched to the Gregorian Calen‐
             dar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -A number
             Display the number of months after the current month.

     -B number
             Display the number of months before the current month.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selection).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlighting).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: “cal
     89” will not display a calendar for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by the current locale.  Month and year
     default to those of the current system clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example “-3 -A 2 -B 3 -y -m 7” would mean: show me the three
     months around the seventh month, three before that, two after that and the whole year.  ncal will warn
     about these combinations.

     A year starts on January 1.

     calendar(3), strftime(3)

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of
     the cal command is supposed to be bit for bit compatible to the original Unix cal command, because its out‐
     put is processed by other programs like CGI scripts, that should not be broken. Therefore it will always
     output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain data. This extra blank line also appears with the original cal com‐
     mand, at least on solaris 8

AUTHORS
     The ncal command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig ⟨helbig@FreeBSD.org⟩.

BUGS
     The assignment of Julian–Gregorian switching dates to country codes is historically naive for many coun‐
     tries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will give varying results.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associ‐
       ated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that  can  change
              the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change  the  specified  time:  WORD  is  access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or
              mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb  2004  16:21:42
       -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating cal‐
       endar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,  and  numbers.   An  empty
       string  indicates  the beginning of the day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily docu‐
       mented here but is fully described in the info documentation.
